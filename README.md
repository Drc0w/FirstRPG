#FirstRPG

Hello everyone,

We are working on a small RPG game in Console in C++ language.
The goal is to learn the way class are used in C++. And in order to learn this,
we just wanna have some fun.

So we decided to make a little RPG game with characters and ennemies. The goal
of the RPG is to evolve one or two characters by fighting some ennemies.

Enjoy our video game :)
